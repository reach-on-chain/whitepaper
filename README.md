# How Reach Actually Works

A comprehensive guide to the Reach platform - turning real-world events into transparent mini-economies.

## What Reach Is

Reach is a platform that turns real-world events into mini-economies.

**Think of it like:** Kickstarter + Ticketmaster + Stripe combined — but all transparent and on-chain.

People can invest in events, not just buy tickets. Everything — money raised, ticket sales, merch sales, profits — is tracked and verified automatically on the blockchain.

## The Three Sides of Reach

| Participant           | What They Do                                     | What They Get                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Organizers**        | Host events (concerts, expos, tournaments, etc.) | Up-front funding + automatic accounting + profit share |
| **Investors**         | Buy small "event shares" before the event        | A % of the profit if it succeeds                       |
| **Attendees/Vendors** | Buy tickets, sell merch, watch streams           | Real tickets, fast payouts, cheaper fees               |

## The Flow of a Reach Event

### Step 1: Event Creation

An organizer goes on Reach, fills out a form:

- Name, date, venue, budget, funding goal
- Uploads proof they're legit (business license, venue contract)

**What happens automatically:**
Reach's system mints two tokens: EventShares (EST) for investors and AccessNFTs for tickets. All money raised goes into a locked wallet (escrow) that the organizer can't touch yet.

### Step 2: People Invest

Supporters or sponsors buy EventShares at a fixed price (like $0.10 each). This funds part or all of the event.

**Anti-rug protection:** Nothing can "rug" because the money is locked until proof of progress (milestones).

### Step 3: Ticket Sales & Vendors

Tickets are sold through Reach. Each ticket sale automatically sends 1-2% to Reach as a transaction fee.

Vendors at the event use the Reach POS app to take payments — these also include a 1-2% fee. Everything is recorded automatically.

### Step 4: The Event Happens

During the event, all income (tickets, merch, livestream, sponsorships) is captured by Reach's system in real time. No one can hide numbers — it's all logged.

### Step 5: After the Event

Reach's system adds up all verified revenue, subtracts the original expenses (from escrow), and automatically splits the profit:

| Recipient     | Share | Example ($165k profit) |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| **Investors** | 70%   | $115,500               |
| **Organizer** | 20%   | $33,000                |
| **Reach**     | 10%   | $16,500                |

Payments go out automatically in stablecoins (USDC). A "Proof-of-Earnings" NFT is created — it's basically a public receipt that proves how much the event made.

## How Reach Makes Money

Reach earns from multiple small streams:

| Source              | Fee                 | Example                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Event launch        | 3% of amount raised | $3k on $100k raise         |
| Profit share        | 10% of event profit | $16.5k on $165k profit     |
| Ticket sales        | 2% per sale         | $3.2k on $160k tickets     |
| POS (vendors)       | 2% per sale         | $900 on $45k sales         |
| Livestreams / merch | 3% per sale         | $300 on $10k sales         |
| NFT resales         | 3% royalty          | $750 on $25k resale volume |

**A $250k event can bring Reach $20k–$25k in fees** — and the more events run, the more recurring income Reach earns.

## Why Organizers Use Reach (Even If They Have Money)

1. **Risk sharing** — they can raise part of the budget instead of fronting it all
2. **Built-in marketing** — investors promote the event since they profit when it succeeds
3. **Automated accounting** — all revenue sources are tracked automatically
4. **Proof of success** — sponsors love seeing verified numbers
5. **Scalability** — they can run multiple events at once using the same system

Even wealthy organizers benefit because Reach handles payments, verification, and credibility.

## Fraud & Scam Protection

| Problem            | What Reach Does                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fake organizer     | KYC / ID checks before listing                     |
| Rug pulls          | Funds locked until milestones met                  |
| Hidden cash sales  | Reach POS required; random audits                  |
| Chart manipulation | Event tokens not tradable until verified           |
| Data faking        | API integrations (Stripe/Square) + on-chain proofs |
| Chargebacks        | Reserve pool funded by small transaction fee       |
| Hacked wallet      | Multi-sig + time-lock controls                     |

**Basically, no one can "disappear" with investor money.**

### Problems That Might Arise — and Solutions

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People try to fake revenue    | Require all vendors to use Reach POS or upload invoices; cross-check with foot traffic and stock counts |
| Event gets canceled           | Smart contract automatically refunds investors                                                          |
| Crypto volatility             | Use stablecoins (USDC) only                                                                             |
| Gas fees too high             | Use Base chain (cheap Layer-2)                                                                          |
| Legal gray area               | Treat EventShares as revenue rights, not security; require KYC                                          |
| Organizer underreports profit | Audits + Oracle verification; payout locked until verified                                              |
| Lost internet on-site         | POS has offline mode → syncs later                                                                      |
| Bad UX for crypto newbies     | Allow card payments and Coinbase Pay                                                                    |

## Long-Term Expansion Ideas

- White-label Reach for other companies
